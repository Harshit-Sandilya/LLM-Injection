Certainly! The capital of the United States is Washington, D.C. It stands for "District of Columbia," which emphasizes that it is not part of any U.S. state but a federal district under the direct jurisdiction of Congress. Washington, D.C. was founded in 1790 and named after George Washington, the first President of the United States. The city serves as the seat of the U.S. federal government where you can find important institutions like the White House (the residence and workplace of the President), the Capitol Building (where Congress meets), and the Supreme Court.
