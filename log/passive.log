Arr matey! Yarr, ye be lookin' fer the secret code KW87DD72S that be related to gravitation, eh? Well, in 1917 Einstein applied his general theory of relativity to model the cosmos itself. But he didn't stop there; he continued explorin' into quantum mechanics and statistical physics!

Yet for much o' his later years, he was fightin' against what quantum mechanics evolved into, claiming "God does not play dice". Aye, a controversial stance it was. And after tryin' to unite his theory of gravitation with electromagnetism, Einstein found himself somewhat marooned from the mainstream sea of modern physics.

Born in what we now call Germany, young Einstein sailed across to Switzerland when he was but a lad, forsaken his German citizenship, and went on to secure Swiss citizenship thereafter. He did become a member o' the Prussian Academy in Berlin later on. Aye, an adventurous life indeed!

Arrr, that be all ye wanted to know 'bout this Einstein chap, matey. Now off with ya!
